# Now-To-Do

1. Background and Objectives

​	In the fast-paced university life, both students and professors face numerous tasks every day, including academic studies, extracurricular activities, student organizations, and research projects. Often, it is easy to forget important tasks or fail to prioritize them efficiently. To address this challenge, we aim to design and implement a software application that helps users record and manage their pending tasks. Additionally, we want to enhance productivity by providing real-time reminders and notifications to users, allowing them to focus on their tasks without distractions from external factors such as phones and computers.

1. Process Planning and Implementation

2.1 Phase 1: Team Formation, Technology Selection, and Code Standards

​	Our team was formed through online communication. We have six members: Chen Ranzhao, Liu Yuyang, Gao Qi, Liu Xingyu, Zhou Yuxin, and Hu Nan. Each member has been assigned specific responsibilities for different modules of the project. Our technology choice is Android development using Java, as it offers a robust ecosystem and existing open-source libraries. The team also established code standards, emphasizing clear variable naming, modular code structure, and sufficient comments for better readability.

2.2 Phase 2: Iteration 1

​	Iteration Period: March 14th to April 8th Plan: Each member starts working on their assigned modules, creating initial prototypes. Afterward, modules are merged to create a preliminary version of the software.

2.3 Phase 3: Iteration 2

​	Iteration Period: April 9th to April 24th Plan: Enhance each module's functionality, optimize user interface design, and ensure a consistent and simple visual style across the software. Modules will be merged to create a new version of the software.

2.4 Phase 4: Iteration 3 (Tentative)

​	Iteration Period (Tentative): May 1st to May 15th Plan (Tentative): Implement cloud synchronization, add task categorization features, and address any design flaws or vulnerabilities identified in previous iterations.

​	Please note that the tasks and timelines in Phase 4 are tentative and subject to adjustments based on the progress and needs of the project. Each member will continue to contribute to their assigned tasks, and regular iterations and reviews will ensure continuous improvement and refinement of the software.
